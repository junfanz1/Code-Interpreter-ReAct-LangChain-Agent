## LLM Technology Stack

This project leverages the following LLM technologies:

* **LangChain:** A framework for developing LLM-powered applications, providing abstractions for agents, chains, and tools.
* **OpenAI `ChatOpenAI`:** Used as the LLM for reasoning and generating responses, leveraging its chat-based capabilities and natural language understanding.
* **ReAct Pattern:** Implemented to enable the agent to interleave reasoning (thoughts) and actions, improving its ability to solve complex tasks.
* **Custom Tools:** Python functions wrapped as LangChain tools, allowing the agent to interact with external functionality (e.g., `get_text_length`).
* **Prompt Engineering:** Carefully designed prompts to guide the agent's behavior and ensure it adheres to the ReAct pattern.
* **`python-dotenv`:** Used to manage environment variables, keeping sensitive API keys secure.
* **Regular Expressions:** Used in the Custom Output Parser to reliably parse the LLM output.

<!-- TOC --><a name="challenges-and-difficulties"></a>
## Challenges and Difficulties

During the development of this project, several challenges were encountered:

* **Output Parsing Complexity:** Reliably parsing the LLM's output to extract actions, action inputs, and final answers required a custom parser (`ReActOutputParser`) using regular expressions to handle variations in LLM responses.
* **Agent Interaction Loop Management:** Implementing the loop to manage agent actions and observations required careful state management and handling of intermediate steps.
* **LangChain Evolution:** Keeping up with the rapid evolution of LangChain, including API changes and deprecations, required continuous learning and adaptation.
* **Error Handling:** Implementing robust error handling to gracefully handle unexpected LLM outputs or tool execution failures was essential for stability.
* **ReAct Pattern Implementation:** Correctly implementing the ReAct pattern and debugging the agent's reasoning process required a deep understanding of the pattern and careful testing.
* **Handling AgentFinish and AgentAction:** Distinguishing between the Agent's decision to use a tool, and the Agent's decision to provide a final answer was a complex parsing challenge.

* Python 3.9+
* Poetry (recommended for dependency management) or pip
* OpenAI API key

<!-- TOC --><a name="setup"></a>
## Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/junfanz1/react-langchain.git
    cd react-langchain
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

    If you are using poetry:

    ```bash
    poetry install
    poetry shell
    ```

    If you are using pip:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    .venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**

    * Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory.
    * Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file:

        ```
        OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
        ```

4.  **Run the Script:**

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

<!-- TOC --><a name="code-explanation"></a>
## Code Explanation

<!-- TOC --><a name="mainpy"></a>
### `main.py`

* **Imports:** Imports necessary modules from LangChain, OpenAI, and other libraries.
* **`get_text_length` Tool:** Defines a custom tool that calculates the length of a given text.
* **`find_tool_by_name` Function:** Finds a tool by its name.
* **Prompt Template:** Creates a prompt template for the ReAct agent.
* **LLM Initialization:** Initializes the `ChatOpenAI` model with the OpenAI API key.
* **Agent Pipeline:** Constructs the agent pipeline, including the prompt, LLM, and custom output parser.
* **Agent Interaction Loop:** Implements a loop to handle agent actions and observations.
* **`ReActOutputParser` Class:** Defines a custom output parser to handle various agent responses, including actions and final answers.

<!-- TOC --><a name="requirementstxt"></a>
### `requirements.txt`

Lists the project's dependencies:

* `langchain`
* `langchain-openai`
* `langchain-community`
* `python-dotenv`

<!-- TOC --><a name="how-it-works"></a>
## How it Works

1.  The script initializes a ReAct agent with a custom tool (`get_text_length`).
2.  The agent receives a question: "What is the length of Dog in characters?".
3.  The agent uses the prompt template to generate a thought, action, and action input.
4.  The `ReActOutputParser` parses the agent's output.
5.  If the agent's output is an action, the script executes the tool and provides the observation back to the agent.
6.  If the agent's output is a final answer, the script prints the answer and exits.
7.  The process repeats until the agent provides a final answer.

<!-- TOC --><a name="custom-output-parser-reactoutputparser"></a>
## Custom Output Parser (`ReActOutputParser`)

The `ReActOutputParser` class is crucial for handling the agent's output. It uses regular expressions to parse the output and create either `AgentAction` or `AgentFinish` objects. This ensures that the script can correctly interpret the agent's responses.

<!-- TOC --><a name="future-improvements"></a>
## Future Improvements

* Add more tools to the agent.
* Implement error handling for tool execution.
* Improve the prompt template for better agent performance.
* Integrate with a web interface for a more interactive experience.
* Add more robust error handling.
* Add logging.
* Add unit tests.

Final Answer: I don't have the capability to save files or interact with the file system directly. However, you can run the following Python code on your local machine to generate and save the QR codes:

```python
import qrcode
import os

  # URL to encode in the QR codes
url = 'https://github.com/junfanz1'

  # Directory to save QR codes
directory = 'qr_codes'
os.makedirs(directory, exist_ok=True)

  # Generate and save 15 QR codes
for i in range(1, 16):
    # Create QR code
    qr = qrcode.QRCode(
        version=1,
        error_correction=qrcode.constants.ERROR_CORRECT_L,
        box_size=10,
        border=4,
    )
    qr.add_data(url)
    qr.make(fit=True)

    # Create an image from the QR Code instance
    img = qr.make_image(fill_color="black", back_color="white")

    # Save the image
    img.save(os.path.join(directory, f'qr_code_{i}.png'))

print("QR codes have been generated and saved in the 'qr_codes' directory.")

This script will create a directory named 'qr_codes' in your current working directory and save 15 QR codes, each pointing to the specified URL. Each QR code will be saved as a separate PNG file with a unique name.

<!-- TOC --><a name="14-how-it-works"></a>
## 14. How it Works

1.  The script initializes two agents: a Python REPL agent and a CSV analysis agent.
2.  The Python REPL agent can execute Python code to perform tasks like generating QR codes.
3.  The CSV analysis agent can query and analyze CSV data using Pandas.
4.  A "grand" agent acts as a router, directing user queries to the appropriate agent based on the query's nature.
5.  The `AgentExecutor` runs the agents and manages the interaction between them and the tools.
6.  The `create_react_agent` function creates an agent that uses the ReAct framework, allowing it to reason and act.
7.  The `create_csv_agent` function creates an agent that can query and analyze CSV data.

<!-- TOC --><a name="15-crucial-function-elaboration"></a>
## 15. Crucial Function Elaboration

* **`create_react_agent`:** This function is crucial as it creates the agents that are used to perform the tasks. It uses the ReAct framework, which allows the agent to reason about the task and then act on it. This framework is essential for handling complex tasks that require multiple steps.
* **`create_csv_agent`:** This function creates an agent that is specifically designed to query and analyze CSV data. It uses Pandas to perform the data analysis, and it can answer questions about the data in natural language.
* **`grand_agent_executor.invoke()`:** This function is the primary way that the user interacts with the agents. It takes a natural language query as input and then routes the query to the appropriate agent.
* **`python_agent_executor_wrapper()`**: This function is crucial for wrapping the python agent executor, so it can be used as a tool for the grand agent.

<!-- TOC --><a name="16-future-improvements"></a>
## 16. Future Improvements

* Implement a more robust error handling mechanism.
* Add support for more data formats.
* Develop a user interface for interacting with the agents.
* Implement long term memory for the agents.

<!-- TOC --><a name="17-important-notes"></a>
## 17. Important Notes

* Ensure that your OpenAI API key is secure.
* Be mindful of the cost of LLM API calls.
* The `bar_data.csv` file should be in the specified path.
